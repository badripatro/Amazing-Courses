##Lecture Notes:
- [CMU-Computer Music Systems and Information Processing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music//cmsip/slides/)

	  - Concepts and techniques for representing and manipulating discrete music information, both in real time and off line. 
	  - Representations of music as explicitly timed event sequences will be introduced, and students will learn how to build efficient run-time systems for event scheduling, tempo control, and interactive processing.
	  - The MIDI protocol is used to capture real-time performance information and to generate sound. 
	  - The course will also cover non-real-time processing of music data, including Markov models, style recognition, computer accompaniment, query-by-humming, and algorithmic composition. 
	  - Introduction to Computer Music, which focuses on sound synthesis and signal processing
